Loop Blocking

It is possible to treat loop blocking as strip-mining in two or more dimensions. Loop blocking is a useful technique for memory performance optimization. 
The main purpose of loop blocking is to eliminate as many cache misses as possible. 
This technique transforms the memory domain into smaller chunks rather than sequentially traversing through the entire memory domain.
Each chunk should be small enough to fit all the data for a given computation into the cache, thereby maximizing data reuse.
