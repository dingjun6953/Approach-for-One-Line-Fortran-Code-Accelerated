# Approach-for-One-Line-Fortran-Code-Accelerated
I accelerated one line Fortran code in terms of advice from Intel technology support staff
I did a lot of tests and the test results were collected in excel files. 
I implemented this technology according to the suggestions from the Intel techology support staff several years ago. So I am here to share it with the public. 
Hopefully it helps to the public. 
Intel Fortran compiler was used.
